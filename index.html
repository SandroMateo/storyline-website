          <p >Are you ready to learn what makes the Storyline Method so successful in the classroom?

          <p>The Storyline I: An Introduction course is for K-12 teachers who wish to learn how to integrate curriculum using the Storyline method.  Participants will experience a Storyline unit both as a student in the process, as well as observer of the teaching method.  Explore how and why the Storyline method motivates students to learn as they become their own ‘meaning makers.’</p>

          <p>Storyline Revisited is for you if you’d like a refresher!  This course is run concurrently with the introductory course and provides a refresher for people who are looking for the support and would like to create a new Storyline topic.</p>
