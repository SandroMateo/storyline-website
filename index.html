  <h4>Storyline I: An Introduction & Storyline Revisited</h4>

  <p>Are you ready to learn what makes the Storyline Method so successful in the classroom?

  The Storyline I: An Introduction course is for K-12 teachers who wish to learn how to integrate curriculum using the Storyline method.  Participants will experience a Storyline unit both as a student in the process, as well as observer of the teaching method.  Explore how and why the Storyline method motivates students to learn as they become their own ‘meaning makers.’

  Storyline Revisited is for you if you’d like a refresher!  This course is run concurrently with the introductory course and provides a refresher for people who are looking for the support and would like to create a new Storyline topic.</p>
